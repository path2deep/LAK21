# LAK21
For the analysis we are provided with two datasets, a. Eventstreamdatasets   b, QuizScore datasets
 
 This directory contains three file. 
 1. LAK20-21 Analysis of operation used by high and low scoring students at Macro level.
 2. LAK21 Time spent on content by high and low scoring students.
 3. LAk20-21 micro level analysis on each content by high and low scoring students
 

We are trying to identify the "SRL" strategy used by high and low scoring students. For this purpose we have classified the students scoring greater than 70
as high scoring students and student scoring less than 30 marks as low scoring students.
* This include 2243 number of students belonging to each category.
* we have 10 million clickstream data(eventstream data)
* there are total of 10,000 students using the bookroll

# a number of operation used by students are 
'NEXT', 'PREV', 'OPEN', 'ADD BOOKMARK', 'DELETE BOOKMARK', 'PAGE_JUMP', 'ADD MARKER', 'SEARCH', 'SEARCH_JUMP', 'CLOSE', 'DELETE MARKER', 'CHANGE MEMO', 'ADD MEMO', 
'DELETE_MEMO'


# LAK20-21 Analysis of operation used by high and low scoring students at Macro level.
  
  a. We have calculate how many times each operation used by all high scoring students and low scoring students over al the content(0-52)
  
  b. We have calculted on each content(0-52) how many operation are used by low high and low scoring students

#   LAK21 Time spent on content by high and low scoring students.

   this file shows the time spent by high and low scoring students on each content ie content_0 onwards

# LAk20-21 micro level analysis on each content by high and low scoring students

   This file shows the micro level analysis on each content. 
   
   How high and low scoring students uses each operation on a given conten page.
